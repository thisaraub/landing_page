WHAT IS A PROCFILE? ===================================================================================

Itâ€™s just a file named Procfile (no file extension) that contains one line specifying how to 
start your app. For a Flask app, it typically looks like this:

web: python app.py

This means:

web: Specifies the type of service you're running. In most cases, it's a web app.
python app.py: The command to start your Flask app. 
Replace app.py with the name of your Python file if it's named differently.


HOW TO CREATE A PROCFILE? ===================================================================================

Open Your Project Folder:

Navigate to the folder where your Flask app is located (the same place as your app.py file).

Create the Procfile:

If you're using a text editor like VSCode or Notepad:
Create a new file and name it exactly Procfile (no file extension like .txt).
If you're using the terminal/command line:

touch Procfile

Add the Command:

Open the Procfile and add the line:

web: python app.py

Save the File:

Save and close the file.
