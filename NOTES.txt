WHAT IS A PROCFILE? ===================================================================================

Itâ€™s just a file named Procfile (no file extension) that contains one line specifying how to 
start your app. For a Flask app, it typically looks like this:

web: python app.py

This means:

web: Specifies the type of service you're running. In most cases, it's a web app.
python app.py: The command to start your Flask app. 
Replace app.py with the name of your Python file if it's named differently.



HOW TO CREATE A PROCFILE? ===================================================================================

1. Open Your Project Folder:

2. Navigate to the folder where your Flask app is located (the same place as your app.py file).

3. Create the Procfile:

If you're using a text editor like VSCode or Notepad:
Create a new file and name it exactly Procfile (no file extension like .txt).
If you're using the terminal/command line:

touch Procfile

4. Add the Command:

Open the Procfile and add the line:

web: python app.py

5. Save the File:

Save and close the file.



MAKING CHANGES TO LANDING PAGE AND PREVIEWING IT? ===================================================================================

1. Open Your Project in VS Code:

Ensure the project files for your landing page are opened in VS Code.

2. Modify Your Code:

Make any changes to your HTML, CSS, or Flask app.py files.

3. Preview Changes Locally:

Run Flask Locally:
Open the VS Code terminal and activate your virtual environment (if required).
Run the following command to start your Flask app:

python app.py

The terminal will show an address like http://127.0.0.1:5000/. 
Open this in your browser to preview the changes.

4. Test the Changes:

Navigate through the locally running app to ensure everything works as expected.
